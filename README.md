# test-plane
Source code for the test plane to collect image data to train our CV models with.

## Setup
If you don't already have it, download Android Studio from https://developer.android.com/studio.

When downloading and running this project for the first time, first clone the repository, then, open up Android Studio and open the project.
The project to be opened is 
```
test-plane/TestPlane/ 
```
and you should see an Android icon next to the TestPlane folder.

Once you open this up, the configuration should be automatically detected. This will not happen immediately, however; the Gradle build process will take about a minute to run, and you can check it's progress at the very bottom of your screen. If this process is finished and the configuration is still not detected, try recloning. If this still doesn't work, you may have to add your own configuration manually.


## Running
To run the project, simply hit the green run button in Android Studio.
